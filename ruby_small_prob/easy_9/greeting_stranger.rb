=begin
Create a method that takes 2 arguments, an array and a hash. The array will contain 2 or more
elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces, will produce a person's name.
The hash will contain two keys, :title and :occupation, and the appropriate values.
Your method should return a greeting that
uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title and occupation.


=end

def greetings(arr, hsh)
  "Hello, #{arr.join(' ')}! Nice to have a #{hsh[:title]} #{hsh[:occupation]} around."
end

p greetings(['John', 'Q', 'Doe'], { title: 'Master', occupation: 'Plumber' })
#=> "Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around."
